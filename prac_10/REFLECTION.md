Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate normally is not accurate, could be off by 30 minutes

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

at first i underestimated the accuracy, but after some time i started overestimating the accuracy and found a perfect balance to that

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Its good to set a time goal to reach to not overthink certain problems

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

i learned that there are more efficient ways to actually do my codes

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

some people had very interesting solutions to the problems which is in a way i never thought of

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

https://github.com/harryg1244/cp1404practicals/pull/2#event-14750619590

### Explanation

As my first code review, i felt like i did a good job to try and spot what can be improved, and in this case he forgot to adjust the size label

### Good Code Review 2

https://github.com/Webby04/cp1404practicals/pull/2#event-15094954733

### Explanation

In this code review, i was able to point out that he could have returned the formula without creating it into a variable first which can help shorten the code

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I feel like some practicals take way too long to do, such as practical 7, but i do think that they are good practices to have

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

i always made sure that i submitted every practical on time
